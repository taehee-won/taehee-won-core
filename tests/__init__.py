# tests/__init__.py

# This file enables the unittest framework
# to recognize this directory as a Python package.
# It is essential for including these tests in the discovery process.

# To run tests for the taehee-won-core project:
# Use 'python -m unittest' for standard testing,
# or 'python -m unittest -v' for verbose output,
# executed from the root directory.
